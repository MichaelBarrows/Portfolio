Freshers' week provides the opportunity for new students to connect with their peers and to get used to what is expected of them at university. This period is crucial to ensure that students successfully integrate into university life. Students can experience information overload as the communication of information is one way and the information is dull. Information overload can lead to a student being unable to successfully integrate into university life, which can in turn lead to their withdrawal from the university or impact upon their successes during their course. Technology can be used to improve the induction process, by making information more interactive, students may be more engaged with the information which could resolve the problem of one-way communication. Chatbots can be considered to be a novelty and research has shown that users may be more likely to engage with novel technologies.",

The technical implementation aspect was completed by comparing two chatbot implementation methods: chatterbot (a Python package) and BotMan Studio (a PHP framework).

Whilst the chatbot being able to learn from its conversations with users is an advantage, it is also a drawback, as the chatbot could be taught responses which are inappropriate (e.g. racism and xenophobia). Other disadvantages included the steep learning curve and narrow time frame. The BotMan Studio framework was found to have a less steep learning curve as I have used PHP extensively throughout my degree as well as the Laravel framework. Given more time, the chatbot would have been developed using the chatterbot package.",

When the question matched was very broad, a follow up question would be returned with pre-defined follow up options so that the response returned would be more focussed and specific to the information required to the user. The response provided could also contain links to external information if this was more appropriate than displaying the information within the application. Initially, the chatbot would compare every word in the users query with every word in each question, meaning that the chatbot would be considering words such as 'and', 'of' and 'can' which did not help to identify the correct question. To improve the accuracy and performance of the chatbot, the Keyword Extractor API was created which extracted and stored keywords from questions and extracted keywords from the user's query. This meant that the chatbot could compare the keywords, which reduced processing time and returned more accurate results. The chatbot can be used without the Keyword Extractor API, however the accuracy and performance are diminished.",

The applications were coded according to the stage of the test that needed to be passed. The BDD tests had to be adapted due to issues with JavaScript functionality in the chatbot. The affected tests were modified to test the backend functionality and more tests created to test the data being returned from the BotMan API rather than test it being displayed to the user.
