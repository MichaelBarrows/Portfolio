                    <p>For my research project, I evaluated how well machine learning algorithms perform at identifying
                    sentiment and emotion in Iranian state-sponsored propaganda on Twitter about the nuclear deal. This
                    project has involved extracting the tweets using keywords, preprocessing the text of the tweets,
                    labelling the tweets for sentiment and emotion automatically using a lexicon (SentiWordNet and NRC
                    Emotion Lexicon) and evaluating five machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision
                    Tree, Random Forest, Linear SVM, and Naive Bayes) performance at sentiment analysis and emotion
                    detection.</p>

                    <p>For my dissertation, I investigated the technical feasibilty of implementing a chatbot for new
                    students within Edge Hill University's department of Computer Science. This was completed by
                    evaluating two chatbot implementation methods (Chatterbot - a Python paackage and BotMan Studio -
                    a PHP framework). I then implemented a chatbot (and a FAQ's mobile website) and conducted a
                    usability evaluation with a questionnaire to evaluate and compare the perceived usefulness of a
                    chatbot and a FAQ's mobile website for new students (with first year Computer Science students).
                    Results show that the chatbot was perceived to be more useful than the FAQ's mobile website.</p>
